1. Introduction

MOD_FreeSurf2D is a set of Matlab scripts that solve the
depth-averaged, shallow water equations in general situations. These
scripts require Matlab for execution.  This program is designed to
simulate water flow in rivers, streams, and shallow estuaries.

This version of MOD_FreeSurf2D has been augmented to use an HDF5 
file for input and ouput. Additional information on input parameters, HDF5 
file format, and on the use of this program can be found in
the manual, MOD_FreeSurf2DManual.pdf, located in the Docs
directory and in the Jupyter Notebooks located in Examples\JNotes. 
This code is described in "MOD_FreeSurf2D: a Matlab surface
fluid flow code for rivers and streams" by N. Martin and S. Gorelick.
